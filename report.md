## Data Viz Summary

This figure shows a line chart created by FiveThirtyEight that displays counts of "daily kidnappings" in Nigeria over the course of several years. The chart presents the data as if it were a reliable measure of the number of kidnappings happening each day. However, as the authors of Data Feminism point out, the data is not reliable, as it is based on media reports rather than actual events. This means that the chart is not an accurate representation of reality and is, therefore, misleading.

## Data Viz Biography

**Who or what institution produced the visualization? (Hint: refer to "Figure Credits")** 
 FiveThirtyEight, a news website that focuses on opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports.

**When was it produced?**
The visualization was produced in 2014.

**Who is the audience for the visualization?** 
The audience for the visualization is likely anyone interested in tracking events related to kidnappings in Nigeria.

**How might the visualization be interpreted or misinterpreted? What consequences might this interpretation/misinterpretation have?** 
The visualization might be interpreted as an accurate representation of the number of kidnappings happening in Nigeria. However, as the authors of Data Feminism point out, the data is based on media reports, which are not a reliable measure of actual events. Misinterpreting the chart could lead people to believe that there is a higher or lower rate of kidnappings than is actually occurring, which could have significant consequences for individuals and organizations working in the region.

**How, if at all, does the data visualization represent power or systems?**
The visualization represents power in several ways. First, it is produced by a major news outlet, which gives it a certain level of authority and legitimacy. Second, the chart is presented as an objective representation of reality, even though it is based on unreliable data. This can reinforce the idea that data is inherently neutral and objective, which can mask the ways in which power and bias shape the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data.
